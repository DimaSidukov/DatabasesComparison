# DatabasesComparison

Implements several databases:
1) Room
2) SQLiteOpenHelper
3) Realm
4) ObjectBox
5) 

Which principle Room uses under the hood? Does it use MVCC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)?
What is DAO pattern in database? Any analogues?

Look up for Realm. He is considered to be quite efficient since it is written in C++

**Object-oriented database** vs **Object-relational database**
