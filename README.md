# DatabasesComparison

Implements several databases:
1) Room ☑️
2) SQLiteOpenHelper ☑️
3) Realm
4) ObjectBox

Which principle Room uses under the hood? Does it use MVCC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)?
What is DAO pattern in database? Any analogues?

Look up for Realm. He is considered to be quite efficient since it is written in C++

**Object-oriented database** vs **Object-relational database**

Add functionality on the screen that allows performing different database operations, such as deleting, inserting, updating and querying data. Remove recyclerview list from the screen and replace with different buttons or something
